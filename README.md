# Pirate Pete's Closet

Pirate Pete's Closet is a free closet supplied with clothes, toiletries, and other essentials that students at our high school may need. We developed an online catalog to help students in our school district get better access to the items they might need without the social stigma. This project was made in approximately 5 weeks for the World Wide Student STEM Form Hackathon.

## World Wide STEM Form

We are unbelivably proud to say that this hackathon project earned the Pattonville Computer Science department $10,000 to help fund even bigger endevors for Capstone and computer science education at Pattonville.
